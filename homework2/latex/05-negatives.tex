Although both Prim and Kruskal's algorithms are defined using graphs that have positive edge weights, both will correctly function given input edged that have negative weights. Both algorithms iterate through the graph, visiting and declaring edges "safe" if they do not create a cycle in the graph (an enclosed area). Thus, both algorithms will create a MST regardless of input edge weight.
